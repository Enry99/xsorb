in line 273, substitute:

                magmoms = [
                    float(mag_line.split()[5]) for mag_line
    
with 
                magmoms = [
                    float(mag_line.split()[-1]) for mag_line

(basically substitute the '5' with '-1'. This will probably be solved in future updates of ase)
