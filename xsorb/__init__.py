Xsorb is a lightweight, flexible and user-friendly tool to generate
and run ab initio calculations of molecules adsorbed over substrates,
relying on VASP and Quantum Espresso for DFT calculations and on
ASE & Pymatgen to generate the adsorption structures.

Please cite the following paper if you use Xsorb in your research:
