'''
Modules with all that pertains to the DFT codes.
All the rest of xsorb is DFT code agnostic, so that it can be easily
extended to other DFT codes.
'''

#The modules are divided by functionality, not by DFT code.
#In this way, we can think of what each code has to do at each given step,
#and it is easier to compare them.
#This implementation detail might be changed in the future.
