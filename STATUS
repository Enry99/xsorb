TODO: make sure that settings are passes only from top-level, i.e. only to the functions in launcher.py, but not further.
TODO: bump to ase 3.23 (need to modify ase_custom and also the constraints everywhere in the code, also read OUTCAR instead of vasprun.xml)
TODO: add check for scf not converged in vasp, and reaching max steps in qe, at the end of the relax
