TODO: add final distance dz in the results

TODO: make sure that settings are passes only from top-level, i.e. only to the functions in launcher.py, but not further.
TODO: bump to ase 3.23 (need to modify ase_custom and also the constraints everywhere in the code, also read OUTCAR instead of vasprun.xml)
TODO: add check for scf not converged in vasp, and reaching max steps in qe, at the end of the relax
#TODO: check that when reading magmoms from input, the order is then changed correctly after resorting the poscar during write_inputs

NOW: do the results(+update db), then do the writing of csv file, then isolated mol and slab.
THEN: do images, then do parser(subparser).
THEN: check if everything works, bump ase to 3.23
FINALLY: xfrag.
